# The Vineek
 Simple, readable, epic 'algorithm' that's designed to create timetables for all courses and their respective semesters while also allocating appropriate classrooms to them such that no clashes in any way will occur. Algorithm should work in a way such that any modifications done to the excel file should reflect in the timetable producted by the algorithm so that any user will have no need to ever touch the code for whatever reason as long as they follow the conventions 😎🐧
